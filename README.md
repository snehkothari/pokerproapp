PokerPro APP

This is the android application which uses the api and model created in the Pokerpro file to implement the hand strength of the player.
This app queries the api and gets the hand strength data.
Is in the form of a game but the functionality of the computer is not added, so it just seems like playing with a player but it's actually not using any logic.
